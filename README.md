# zaztooth
I wanted an easier way to use the Ubertooth one other than running all commands using CLI. The end goal will be to create a web UI for interacting and storing BLE information gathered by the device.

git clone https://github.com/DezusAZ/zaztooth
cd zaztooth
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
open browser to http://localhost:8080
